Rock vs Mine Classifier

This project focuses on building a machine learning model to classify underwater objects detected by sonar signals as either Rocks or Mines. Submarine and sonar detection systems often generate complex numerical readings that represent the reflected sound waves from underwater objects. Distinguishing between harmless rocks and potentially dangerous mines is critical for naval safety and underwater exploration. This project demonstrates how machine learning can be applied to automate and improve this classification task.

The dataset consists of numeric features derived from sonar signals, capturing the intensity and frequency patterns of reflected waves. Each sample represents a single sonar reading, with 60 features corresponding to different aspects of the signal. The target labels indicate whether the object is a rock (R) or a mine (M).

The project workflow involves several key steps:

Data Preprocessing: Raw sonar readings are converted into numerical arrays and reshaped appropriately for model input. This ensures compatibility with the chosen machine learning algorithm.

Model Training: The processed data is split into training and test sets. A classification model (for example, a Random Forest, Logistic Regression, or SVM) is trained on the training data to learn patterns that distinguish rocks from mines. Accuracy metrics are calculated for both training and test sets to evaluate model performance and check for overfitting.

Prediction: The trained model can take new sonar readings as input and predict whether the object is a rock or a mine. This is implemented with a simple function that accepts the input features, reshapes them, and outputs the classification.

User-Friendly Output: Predictions are displayed in a readable format, clearly indicating whether the object is a Rock or a Mine, making the tool accessible for practical use.

The project emphasizes the practical application of machine learning for real-world problems, illustrating how feature extraction, model training, and prediction pipelines work together. With a training accuracy of approximately 83% and test accuracy around 76%, the model demonstrates strong predictive capability, although there is room for improvement with advanced algorithms or feature engineering.

Overall, this project is a hands-on example of using machine learning for sonar-based object classification, highlighting the importance of data preprocessing, model evaluation, and user-friendly prediction systems in real-world safety-critical applications.
